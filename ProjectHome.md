# Reopen Tabs gedit plugin #

The plugin is intended to be used by those who uses [gedit](http://www.gnome.org/projects/gedit/) as a source code editor. It spares you reopening the documents that were loaded last time you closed gedit.

The plugin is writen in interpretive language Python, so you don't need to compile anything. The installation process is fast and easy (see below).

## Features ##

## Localization ##

If you are not familiar with gettext but want to make a translation, just [create an issue](http://code.google.com/p/reopen-tabs-gedit-plugin/issues/entry) and leave your contact information.
